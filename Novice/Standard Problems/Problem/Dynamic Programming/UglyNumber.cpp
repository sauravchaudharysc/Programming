/*You are provided a sequence of number. All numbers of that sequence is in increasing order (including 1) and whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5 (except 1). You need to find the nth number of that sequence.

Input Format
First line contains integer t which is number of test case. For each test case, it contains an integer n.

Constraints
1<=t<=100 1<=n<=10000

Output Format
Print nth number of that sequence.

Sample Input
2
7
10
Sample Output
8
12
Explanation
Sequence : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, â€¦..*/
