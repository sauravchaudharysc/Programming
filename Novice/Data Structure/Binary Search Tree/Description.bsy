//Binary Search Tree
Problem with the binary tree is that search is an expensive operation. Worst case 
complexity to search will O(N).So for this case BST comes to picture.

BST is a special type of Binary Tree . They are ordered. Element having less value are
kept at left and greater at right. Each Sub-tree is a BST.

In the worst case we have to travel the whole depth.O(logn) but in case of skewed it turns
out to O(n).
