/*In this problem you are given a weighted tree containing n nodes and every
city there is one person.In this weighted tree you have to shuffle all the people among the nodes such that the total
movement across the edges is maximized.
Solution: 
     In order to maximize the distance i should maximize the use of every edge.
I will find out how many times edges has been used.
Contribution :- TimesUsed*Length*/
Pigeon Hole Principle 
Helps to find out one edge is used how many times.
